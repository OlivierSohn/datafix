`worklist` [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/worklist.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/sgraf812/worklist)
==========

Library for a simple worklist implementation with dynamic edges. Intentionally
does not build on top of the lattice abstraction, shifting that responsibility
into transfer functions.

This is all work in progress documentation and performance wise, but should
mostly work by now.
